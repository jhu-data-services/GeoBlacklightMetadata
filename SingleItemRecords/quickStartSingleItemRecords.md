# Quick Start Guide for Geoportal single item record metadata

This is a quick start guide for populating the [singleItemsWithBibs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zEQiNprHJgtV6Wwnv4mLyKoaC3oXC3VuH-u7Md3ynek/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet, which will be used for single item map records (stand-alone non-nesting records) that are going into the new Geoportal. Filling out this spreadsheet item by item can feel complicated and arduous, and sometimes you just have to use your best judgment, but there are some common ingredients that can speed up the process. This guide will link to full documentation for when there are ambiguities, but the basic process can be referred to below.

## Spreadsheet row template and example

### Information from Catalyst and JScholarship records

The values for these fields should be pre-filled from the map items' existing records in Catalyst (the online library catalog) and JScholarship, as indicated in the following table.

| Field name | *jscholarship_link* 	|  *bib_link* |  *alt_title* | *datetype* | *date1*	| *date2*  |  *statresp* | *verified_authors* | *nv_authors* | *verified_contributors* | *nv_contributors*	|  *verified_publisher*	|	*nv_publisher* |
