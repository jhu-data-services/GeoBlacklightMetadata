# Quick Start Guide for Geoportal child record metadata

This is a quick start guide for populating the [addMetadataToChildRecords](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CDvMPsgkM1l2BCrAaVFon2m0fR-OnjYvoa8s5fnpTBI/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet, which will be used for child records (records that fit hierarchically below a “parent” record) that are going into the new Geoportal. The most common example of child records to be encountered in this group would be pages within an atlas. Filling out this spreadsheet item by item can feel complicated and arduous, and sometimes you just have to use your best judgment, but there are some common ingredients that can speed up the process. This guide will link to full documentation for when there are ambiguities, but the basic process can be referred to below.

## Spreadsheet row template and example

|	 **[Parent item group]**  |	*[the full repository link from JScholarship]*	|	*[the identifying part of the link that contains the record you need]*	| *[the image files you need from the page and handle linked on the left – the **JPEGs** are faster to load]* | *[the name of the atlas or other “parent” item that this image is part of]* | *[the name of the individual map sheet in the image you’re looking at]* <br><br>**Formula =** <br><br><span style="color:violet">All the title words you see on the sheet</span>,<br> <span style="color:green">Most specific location depicted</span>,<br> <span style="color:orange">Date from the JScholarship record</span><br> <br>For example: <br><br><span style="color:violet">Warren Cotton Mills, Ashland Furnace, Arlington P.O.</span>,<br> <span style="color:green">Baltimore</span>,<br> <span style="color:orange">1877</span> | *[the geographic region depicted in this map sheet image]* <br><br>**To determine:**<br><br>1. Launch the [Klokantech Bounding Box](https://boundingbox.klokantech.com/) tool <br><br>2. Find the general area by typing it into the search box, e.g. “Baltimore,” “Georgia,” or “Montgomery County” <br><br>3. Zoom in or out using the borders of the rectangle, or use the pentagon-shaped drawing tool button to make a new shape freehand <br><br>4. Do not try to make this exact! It is just to make the general area easy for a researcher to pick out on a zoomed-out map<br><br> 5.
